                        <p>On July 11th, we flew from Detroit, Michigan to Frankfurt, Germany for our layover. Originally, we were supposed to fly to Amsterdam, but our change in flight got us an upgrade to Delta One seats! They were super spacious and we were able to lay all the way back in our seats. Then, we flew from Frankfurt to Budapest, Hungary. Jack and I sat in the very back row of the plane. Jack’s luggage got lost but was returned the next day, thankfully!</p>

                    <p>We arrived at our hotel, the Intercontinental Budapest, and rested for a short while because we were tired from all the travel and the time change. Afterwards, we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. We ordered a charcuterie board with hummus, which ended up being Jack’s favorite meal of the trip. </p>

                    <p>At night, we took a night cruise down the Danube River. It was amazing to see Budapest at night, and the Parliament Building was incredible with its lights on. </p>
