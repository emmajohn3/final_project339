                            <p class="note">On July 11th, we flew from Detroit, Michigan to Frankfurt, Germany for our layover. Originally, we were supposed to fly to Amsterdam, but our change in flight got us an upgrade to Delta One seats! They were super spacious and we were able to lay all the way back in our seats. Then, we flew from Frankfurt to Budapest, Hungary. Jack and I sat in the very back row of the plane. Jack’s luggage got lost but was returned the next day, thankfully!</p>
