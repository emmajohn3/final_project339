                <p class="note2">In the morning, we drove to our next hotel in Munich, the Courtyard. Our room wasnâ€™t ready when we got there so we ate lunch at the hotel. Afterwards, we walked around the downtown area of Munich and did some shopping. Then, we saw St. Peter's church and the Glockenspiel, which is a huge mechanical clock. We also visited the famous Hofbrauhaus.</p>

We watched the Glockenspiel performance from the restaurant as the figures spun around while songs were played on bells. </p>
